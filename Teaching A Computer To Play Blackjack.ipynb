    "\n",
    "It all started when a member of the iconic trio went to Las Vegas for a weekend over the semester. While she had never gambled before, everyone would soon find out that Courtney loved blackjack ... a lot. Although her wallet was empty, Courtney left Vegas rich in experience and Blackjack knowledge. Born out of that trip and lost money came an idea, an idea for a CS440 final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those of you reading this report who might not know, in the game of blackjack, players are dealt two cards, and they are dealt cards until they reach or get as close as then can to a card value totaling twenty-one. If the player’s total goes over twenty-one, the player busts and they lose their money. If the player’s total is less than the dealer’s total, the player also loses their money. Really, the player tends to lose their money quite a lot. However, there is a generally universally accepted basic blackjack strategy. If players play with this proper strategy, then the dealer only has about a 0.05% advantage. In other words, “if you are playing for $100 per hand, you can expect to lose about 50 cents each hand.” A chart of this proper strategy is found below:\n",

    "Because of this interesting nature of the basic blackjack strategy, we thought it would be a fascinating project to try training a computer to play blackjack through basic artifical intelligence principles, namely reinforcement learning. Would the computer naturally learn the strategy that all professional blackjack players accept as “proper”? That’s what we set to find out.\n",
